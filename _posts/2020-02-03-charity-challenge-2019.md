This year's event featured the debut of the John Morton Memorial Cup for trans am small bore sedans.

With over 40 cars entered split into two groups and some very close racing.

Bruce McKean managed a second in the first race and a third in the second race. As a bonus he recorded the fastest lap of the entire weekend and was awarded the Morton Trophy for best presentation.

Brian Mertz also returned to action and ran well.

A great way to close out 2019 for Autostrada!
