title: About Us

Fred Schueddekopp was a competitive sailboat racer, a participant in the 1983 America's Cup, and he spent years in the sailmaking industry at North Sails before making the switch to cars.

Many of Fred's restoration skills were developed during his tenure with Mosier Restoration in Los Angeles. Fred started working on Alfa Romeos out of his home garage in Southern California in the late 1980s. Having spent a few years competing with IMSA in the Firestone Firehawk Series, he eventually got involved with vintage car racing through VARA. Racing his own cars quickly led to building and maintaining cars for customers, which he has continued to do ever since.

A typical season for Autostrada, ( [View on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Autostrada-300421716734710/) ) involves six or more events and race support for as many as five cars. Since its inception, Autostrada's focus has been on cars in the 750/101/105 range, specializing in Alfa Romeos along with occasional Formula or Sports Racer. Multiple GTVs, GTAs, and sedans have been built or restored for the track. During the off-season, the race work is done alongside restorations of Alfas from Giuliettas, Spiders & Sprints to 105 series coupes and sedans. Other vintage cars, both British and domestic, have also found their way through the shop. But, today as always, the favorite remains Alfa Romeo!
