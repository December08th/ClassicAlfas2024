    ### Fred Schueddekopp was a competitive sailboat racer, a participant in the _1983 America's Cup_, and he spent years in the sailmaking industry at _North Sails_ before making the switch to motorsports.

    Fred started working on Alfa Romeos out of his home garage in Southern California in the late 1980s. He started his full-time career in the business about 1989. Many of Fred's restoration skills were developed during his tenure with _Mosier Restoration_ in Los Angeles. Having spent a few years competing with _IMSA_ in the _Firestone Firehawk Series_, he eventually got involved with vintage car racing through _VARA_. Racing his own cars quickly led to building and maintaining cars for customers, which he has continued to do ever since.

    A typical season for [Autostrada](https://www.facebook.com/Autostrada-300421716734710/), involves six or more events and race support for as many as five cars. Since its inception, Autostrada's focus has been on cars in the 750/101/105 range, specializing in Alfa Romeos along with occasional Formula or Sports Racer. Multiple GTVs, GTAs, and sedans have been built or restored for the track. During the off-season, the race work is done alongside restorations of Alfas from Giuliettas, Spiders & Sprints to105 series coupes and sedans. Other vintage cars, both British and domestic, have also found their way through the shop. But, today as always, the favorite remains Alfa Romeo!

    ### Kathryn’s  introduction  to  cars  &  racing  started  at  age  7  in  Las  Vegas.  From  her  dad’s  huge  garage  to  the  Stardust  Raceway she  spent  most  weekends  either  watching  the  “Drags”  or  cleaning  parts  and  packing  the  “chute"  of  her  dad’s  AA  Top  Fuel  dragster.

    At  age  25  she  purchased  her  first  Alfa  Spider  and  was  hooked  on  Alfas  from  then  on!  Kathryn  enjoys  attending  vintage  racing  events  with  her  partner  Fred  Schueddekopp  and  driving  her  personal  Alfas  around  the  beautiful  San  Juan  and  Hawaiian  Islands.  She  is  currently  in  the  process  of  restoring  three  classics  with  Fred:  ’67  Alfa  Duetto,  ’59  Giulietta  Spider,  &  a  ’62  Jaguar  E-type.
