    Fred Schueddekopp was a competitive sailboat racer, a participant in the _1983 America's Cup_, and he spent years in the sailmaking industry at _North Sails_ before making the switch to motorsports.

    Fred started working on Alfa Romeos out of his home garage in Southern California in the late 1980s. He started his full-time career in the business about 1989. Many of Fred's restoration skills were developed during his tenure with _Mosier Restoration_ in Los Angeles. Having spent a few years competing with _IMSA_ in the _Firestone Firehawk Series_, he eventually got involved with vintage car racing through _VARA_. Racing his own cars quickly led to building and maintaining cars for customers, which he has continued to do ever since.

    A typical season for [Autostrada](https://www.facebook.com/Autostrada-300421716734710/), involves six or more events and race support for as many as five cars. Since its inception, Autostrada's focus has been on cars in the 750/101/105 range, specializing in Alfa Romeos along with occasional Formula or Sports Racer. Multiple GTVs, GTAs, and sedans have been built or restored for the track. During the off-season, the race work is done alongside restorations of Alfas from Giuliettas, Spiders & Sprints to105 series coupes and sedans. Other vintage cars, both British and domestic, have also found their way through the shop. But, today as always, the favorite remains Alfa Romeo!
