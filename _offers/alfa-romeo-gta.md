## Alfa Romeo GTA

### VIN  #  AR775542

Because of our unique knowledge and experience with these special cars we just had the privilege of brokering the sale of this fine Alfa Romeo GTA. Beautifully restored, this important car was originally sold new to Luanda (Angola). Raced in period with fully documented ownership. Itâ€™s ready for anything, road, rally, shows or even the track. Additionally many of the original parts have remained with the car.
