## ’59  Alfa  Giulietta  Sprint

### VIN  #  AR1493  09420  -  TIPO  750  B

**HISTORY:** This car was raced originally by Dick Barwell in British Columbia, Canada & the Northwest from 1975-1977. His racing accomplishments ( noted below ) are due to his many victories, he was referred to as B.C.’s version of A.J. Foyt! 

When the current owner took possession of the car he entrusted Dennison International, a multiple Pebble Beach “Best of Show” winner, to restore the body to original. Then as now the car has been maintained to the owner’s high standard with no expense spared. The paint and overall presentation is excellent and the car is in race ready condition.

Many of the lovely Sprint features remain in place \~ trunk “airplane” and badging, dash & dash instruments, dash top mirror, radio block-off plate & more.
