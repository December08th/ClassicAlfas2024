**Restoration**

As the low mileage indicates, this car has had very limited exposure to road elements. It has never required any rust or collision repair. The eyebrows and grilles were fitted to the car perfectly. Color was matched exactly and applied by the painter from _Mosier Restoration,_ who previously won “best of show” and “best of class” at Pebble Beach. To this day the paint looks stunning. All the factory gaps remain even all around. All original trim pieces were properly polished or plated including proper clear or black cad on items such as seat sliders. All new rubber gaskets & seals on body & window door opening. Instruments cleaned, calibrated and checked.

The interior and top were expertly done in the exact original style. Correct “coin catcher” seat upholstery and perforated back material with new foam and refinished seat pans. New rear drape, door and quarter panels along with new leather tool straps.

**Mechanical** - Complete overhaul including:

The engine was completely rebuilt with new pistons & liners, bearing, valves, chains etc. and balanced. Flywheel was resurfaced and a new clutch & pressure plate installed. All the numbers match and are the original components that have been with the car since day one. This included matching stamped block, timing cover and lovely Veloce oil pan. The headers are also original and have been ceramic coated.

* Original tunnel case transmission rebuilt w/new syncros
* Original Marelli charging/starting components overhauled
* Re-bush front suspension
* Idler box rebuilt
* Rebuild/re-bush intake manifold & linkages
* Carburetors rebuilt

In total, the restoration involved over the 700 hours plus the cost of paint & upholstery work. A great running & driving Alfa Romeo. Meticulously restored with show quality presentation!
